# Linked List
Exercice project. Contains binaries for Windows and Linux.

## Binaries
- ``linked_list``     - outputs the complete list and pops each value (you'll need to run it in a terminal to see the values).
- ``append_to_file``  - creates `linked_list.txt` (if it doesn't already exist) and appends the popped values to each line.
